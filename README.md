# Hello-World
Hello World program for Python

How long did it take you?
  This program took me about 2 hours to do. I used this as an opportunity for me to familarize myslef and identify any problems with my computer and coding
What resources did you use to complete it?
  I used our small group discussion video, hello world lesson video, and a hello world program website:
What resources were helpful? which were unhelpful?
  I found that videos took more time but were more useful but websites were quicker but harder to understand
What pitfalls caught you up, what mistakes did you make?
  I had an error with windows so i had to research how to fix it and eventually had a conversation with morgan about it. i also had trouble using git push. i was able to initally upload my work to github but when i made changes i wasnt ablt to upload it.
How did you overcome them?
  I used stack overflow and i asked morgan how to solve an issue i had. For the gitpush issue, i used trial and error and i used the error messages to fix my issue
How do i feel now?
  I feel like this was the perfect programming experience, i had some struggles and set backs but i was able to overcome my issues and creat a succesful program
What lessons did i learn?
  Stack overflow and videos are your bestfriend. Just because you have an issue doesnt make it unsolvable and you can make it through it.
